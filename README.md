# ðŸ’» Alumni Bootcamp: Class Coding Challenge 01

### Goal: Complete the following coding challenge during class

Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.
